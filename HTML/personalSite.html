						<a target="_blank" href="http://students.washington.edu/wsmay1/info343/final/index.shtml"><h1>The Dawg House</h1></a>
						<p>
							The Dawg House is a project created by myself and three others as a final project for INFO 343 (client side web development).  The idea was to create a service
							similar to yelp, but for housing in the University District.  On the site, users are able to view apartments, read reviews, and create reviews, which are updated
							on the map in real time.  My role in the project was to write the JavaScript to create the map and place the markers on it.  I also wrote the PHP for users to submit
							reviews, and to write the Latitude and Longitutde of the street addresses to our JSON object.
						</p>
						<a target="_blank" href="http://students.washington.edu/wsmay1/projects/fifteen.html"><h1>Fifteen Puzzle</h1></a>
						<p>
							Originally created for my CSE 154 class, this puzzle is how I learned to handle events and create elements with JavaScript.  The shuffle button will
							shuffle the puzzle randomly, but it will always be a solvable solution.  This was created with raw JavaScript using no frameworks.  The HTML and basic CSS
							were provided, and were not my work.
						</p>
						<h1>CNN and Sports Illustrated Search Engine (currently offline)</h1>
						<p>
							For this project, I built a full stack search engine used to search over Sports Illustrated and CNN articles.  This was done as a solo project over a quarter of school.
							This includes a web crawler, query suggestion service (currently offline due to Azure issues, code samples can be provided), User Interface, and more.  The project was created
							using C# on an Azure cloud service.  Query suggestion was completed with a Trie.  The worker role for web crawling relies on an Azure cloud queue.
						</p>
						<a target="_blank" href="http://ec2-54-187-40-231.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com"><h1>NBA Stats Search</h1></a>
						<p>
							This was an NBA Player's Stats search engine created as a precursor to the above project.  This is built on php with a PDO query to a MySQL database.  Everything here is running on Amazon Web Services.
